## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind css
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript]
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles



### What I learned

I decide to use typescript for this project,in order to know how to implememt it well and its syntax
```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```ts
type CartItem = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  qty: number;
  thumbnail: string;
};
```

### Continued development

I will continue using typescript for my future projects in order to understand it well, because i still find it difficult to implement
